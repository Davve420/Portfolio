                <p>A lot of the pictures I post, I take myself. The best of them though always comes when friends are involved. Being yourself around your friends brings out a new light in you and it is visable on the outside too. Here's me and my best friend after bleaching my hair.</p>

            <h2>Style & Music</h2>
            <p>A lot of my outfits are inspired by music and the cultures revolving that type of music. There are many genres that are heavily influenced by political ideologies. A very obvious example is the punk genre, The scene is filled with rebellious outfits recognized by studs, spikes, leather often filled with patches. The punks doesn't want to disobey but they want to set an example of going against the norms. I think that everyone is a mix och genres and infuences from all around. Me myself love grunge, shoegaze, alternative rap and many more genres. My style is me and I have never felt better with myself. So if you are hesitating on putting on a specific fit or item, DO IT. You often think more about what others will think than they actually do. If you show up like yourself the people that are ment for you have a easier time finding you and vice versa.  </p>
